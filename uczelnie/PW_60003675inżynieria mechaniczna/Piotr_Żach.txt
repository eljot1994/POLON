A real example has been used as a normative qualification criterion allowing the security team to operate. The analysis of physico-mechanical properties of non-linear polymeric material of cellular structure was performed by considering the proposed mathematical description of the issues, based on experimental bench tests and using computer numerical methods. The work is devoted to extending the knowledge of processes occurring during critical interactions in safety systems based on polymer structures. To develop a methodology for identification of phenomena and design of products dedicated to minimizing the effects of accidents. Propose modern methods of verification and selection of passive safety systems. The conducted works were of a multi-criteria and multidisciplinary character guaranteeing direct translation of results and use of effects in other engineering techniques.', 'doi': '10.3233/ATDE200096', 'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3233/ATDE200096', 'issn': '2352751X, 23527528', 'isbn': '9781643681108, 9781643681115', 'volume': '12', 'title': 'Analysis of Phenomena in Safety Systems Made of Hyper-Elastic Materials – Selected Issues', 'series': 'Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering', 'place': 'NL', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'inbook', 'ID': 'gmjv4m', 'link': 'https://doi.org/10.3233/ATDE200096'}
