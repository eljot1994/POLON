Project assumes that corset created on the basis of a 3D scan and patient’s x-ray, after posture correction in a dedicated program, will guarantee anatomical fit. Using additive manufacturing will allow to print shell and padding in one piece, without perceptible boundaries. Smooth combination of variable stiffness materials will allow precise positioning of the pressure surface with optimal shape. Soft padding protects against abrasions and microholes allow body to breathe. Using transparent and multicolour materials will allow creating an individual style corset. To implement the work, research was performed on materials used in PolyJet technology (new material is created in manufacturing process and has properties depending on proportion of base materials). Nonlinear tensile characteristics were obtained. Various models of hyperelastic materials were tested, parameters were identified and Drucker’s stability criteria were examined. Using FEM, stiffness and strength of structure was tested. Values of stresses in structure and surface forces in body contact areas were determined. Corset closing pressure and corset opening were simulated.', 'doi': '10.3233/ATDE200081', 'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3233/ATDE200081', 'issn': '2352751X, 23527528', 'isbn': '9781643681108, 9781643681115', 'volume': '12', 'title': 'The Concept of Applying the Polyjet Matrix Incremental Technology to the Manufacture of Innovative Orthopaedic Corsets – Research and Analysis', 'series': 'Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering', 'place': 'NL', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'inbook', 'ID': 'gmjwpt', 'link': 'https://doi.org/10.3233/ATDE200081'}
