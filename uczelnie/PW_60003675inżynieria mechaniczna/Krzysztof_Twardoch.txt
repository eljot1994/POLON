The purpose of the presented project was to design a cover for the power supply for the LED lamp manufactured by the company based on various design concepts. The work involved in this project was divided into 2 stages. Stage 1 involved construction of the cover using one variant of the design concept. Stage 2 presented a second variant of the design concept. Many design modifications resulted in variety of models adhering to technological objectives and external aesthetics (verified by designer). This paper underlines the extent and complexity of construction design with multiple adjunctive and interrelated stages, where the use of technological innovations in engineering can speed up construction.', 'doi': '10.3233/ATDE200106', 'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3233/ATDE200106', 'issn': '2352751X, 23527528', 'isbn': '9781643681108, 9781643681115', 'volume': '12', 'title': 'Development and Construction of LED Lamp Power Supply Cover Based on the Design Concept for Injection Molding', 'series': 'Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering', 'place': 'NL', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'inbook', 'ID': 'gmjvzj', 'link': 'https://doi.org/10.3233/ATDE200106'}
