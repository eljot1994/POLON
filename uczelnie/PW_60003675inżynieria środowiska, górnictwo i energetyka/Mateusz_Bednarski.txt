The lack of response from states can lead to many consequences. As consumption increases, so does the emission of harmful substances. According to the European Parliament, almost 30% of total CO2 (greenhouse gas affecting the greenhouse effect in the EU) comes from the transport sector, of which 72% is from road transport. Air pollution is a challenge for municipal authorities. According to the data, road transport accounted for approximately 5% of the creation of PM10 particles, ca. 7% of PM2.5 and approximately 32% for NOX. In Poland, suspended particles (PM10 and PM2.5) cause deaths of as many as 45,000 people a year. Therefore, it is necessary to undertake concrete efforts in order to reduce vehicle exhaust emissions as much as possible. Among them, solutions such as downsizing, hybridization of combustion engines or electrification are used. Based on the analyzes, the authors of the paper drew attention to the significant impact, in this process, of the modernization of energy infrastructure. Thanks to this, it is possible to simultaneously increase the share of zero-emission vehicles as well as the use of VtG (Vehicle to Grid) technology. What’s more, the authors of the paper have determined for the main communication routes (TERN) in Poland, the potential for setting up refuelling stations for new types of vehicles, such as hydrogen or electric cars. Finally, the main risks have been presented for drivers, infrastructure and environment as a result of proposed changes.', 'doi': '10.3233/ATDE200132', 'url': 'https://doi.org/10.3233/ATDE200132', 'issn': '2352751X, 23527528', 'isbn': '9781643681108, 9781643681115', 'volume': '12', 'title': 'Global Transport Challenges in Reducing Harmful Emissions: Selected Examples for Polish Part of Trans-European Road Network (TERN)', 'series': 'Advances in Transdisciplinary Engineering', 'place': 'NL', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'inbook', 'ID': 'gmjvwv', 'link': 'https://doi.org/10.3233/ATDE200132'}
